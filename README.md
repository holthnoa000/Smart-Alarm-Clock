# Smart Alarm Clock

Note: This project is very early on in development but I plan to have a working version 1 built in the coming weeks.

The smart display is powered by a Raspberry Pi and currently displays the time and has the Google Assistant built in. An Adafruit matrix hat drives the display and the Python library I am using can be found here https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix. I am working on adding multiple modes to the clock such as showing the weather, stocks, email notifications or other useful data. In its current state the Google Assistant doesn't directly interact with the display in any way but I plan to change this in the near future.

List of features to add: Wooden housing, different display modes, full Google Assistant integration.
